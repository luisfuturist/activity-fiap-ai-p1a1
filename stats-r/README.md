# StatsR

**StatsR** is a subproject that demonstrates how to integrate Python and R for data generation and statistical analysis. It generates a CSV file containing random numbers using Python, and then uses R to perform statistical calculations such as the mean and standard deviation.

## Requirements

To run this subproject, you need both Python and R installed on your system:

- **R**: Required to execute the `stats.R` script. Download and install it from the official website: [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/).
- **Python**: Required to run the `gen.py` script. Download and install it from: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Pip**: Python's package manager, `pip`, is necessary to install the required Python libraries. It usually comes pre-installed with Python.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the subproject:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   Create a virtual environment to isolate the subprojectâ€™s dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   Activate the virtual environment to use it:
   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\.venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```

## Project Structure

- **`gen.py`**: A Python script that generates a CSV file (`data.csv`) with random integers.
- **`stats.R`**: An R script that reads `data.csv` and computes the mean and standard deviation.
- **`data.csv`**: A CSV file generated by `gen.py`, containing a column of random integers.

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate the CSV File with Python

Run the Python script to generate a CSV file (`data.csv`) with 5 random numbers:

```bash
python gen.py
```

This will create `data.csv` in the current directory.

### Step 2: Perform Statistical Analysis with R

Once the `data.csv` file is generated, use R to calculate the mean and standard deviation:

```bash
Rscript stats.R
```

The statistical results will be displayed in the console.

## Example Output

Here is an example of the output you might see after running `stats.R`:

```
Mean: 45.2
Standard Deviation: 20.15
```

(Note: The actual values will vary because the numbers are randomly generated in each run.)
